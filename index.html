Conole (2004) expressed it perfectly when he said, there is a lapse between what is proposed and the actual use of technology in the classroom; there is minimal evidence that fundamental change in education has taken place as a result of the application of emerging technologies. Teachers need to create environments and experiences where students come together, either face-to-face or online, to discover and construct new learning, become members of the community of learners, and solve problems (Barr & Tagg, 1995). In this new ecological learning environment, students learn to be active learners and constructors of their knowledge, developing and creating entire frameworks of new knowledge through collaborative, authentic use of students’ previous knowledge. In keeping with van Lier’s (2000) principles of ecological education, I am continually looking for new ways of teaching, integrating technology into learning, and researching education in order to expand the quality of the learner’s environment both inside and outside the classroom. </p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="34"><p>With changes in technology evolving at unprecedented rates, empowered students who possess 21st century skills will be the most prepared for their future. Students who possess these skills take responsibility for their learning outcomes, becoming more innovative, collaborative, and better critical thinkers both inside and outside the classroom, that is, students see the benefits or gain an understanding of the curriculum objectives. Equipping students for learning in an ecological environment, I want to provide them with suitable tools and learning resources. Many tools and resources can be used to accomplish this goal. Among these, however, it is my belief that technology is the prime resource to this end. Properly designed learning spaces create rich, in-class learning environments in which I not only facilitate interaction, but also build upon them through collaborative face-to-face and online activities providing opportunities to enhance student empowerment and outcomes.</p></div></div></div></section><section id="section-h_GraphicalColumn-4318c111-9d27-4c65-be31-56a9c1fa247d" class="Section Section--components-1 color-bg color-title section-bgcover-wo title-size-medium p-0 text-align-center group-order-normal  colors-black colors-global " data-reactid="35"><div class="Component ms-fx-r fx-w-w j-c-between a-i-stretch" data-reactid="36"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-0 fx-b-50p w-100p ms-w-50p" data-reactid="37"><a class=" " href="research-interests" data-reactid="38"><div class="Cover ov-h" data-reactid="39"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="40"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/4984af4daa320e2378c2282c5c3568fe/passthrough.png?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fd1656adc7d798af8695549f8cb90d36ae010fc45.png&amp;width=781" style="object-position:91.54929577464789% 63.50574712643679%;" data-reactid="41"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/4984af4daa320e2378c2282c5c3568fe/passthrough.png?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fd1656adc7d798af8695549f8cb90d36ae010fc45.png&amp;width=781" style="object-position:91.54929577464789% 63.50574712643679%;" data-reactid="42"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/cc5fa92fd54df1368ddd3f2e41ba1127/passthrough.png?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fd1656adc7d798af8695549f8cb90d36ae010fc45.png&amp;width=720" style="object-position:91.54929577464789% 63.50574712643679%;" data-reactid="43"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/1759eacaea8f2e3805ecb48e6665fd6b/passthrough.png?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fd1656adc7d798af8695549f8cb90d36ae010fc45.png&amp;width=360" style="object-position:91.54929577464789% 63.50574712643679%;" data-reactid="44"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="781" data-height="348" data-ratio="2.2442528735632186" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/4984af4daa320e2378c2282c5c3568fe/passthrough.png?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fd1656adc7d798af8695549f8cb90d36ae010fc45.png&amp;width=781" style="object-position:91.54929577464789% 63.50574712643679%;" data-reactid="45"/></picture></div></a></div><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-2 ms-p-3 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8 color-title fx-b-50p" data-reactid="46"><div class="System-font  Headline" data-reactid="47"><h1 data-reactid="48"><span class="" data-reactid="49"><a class="font-title " href="research-interests" data-reactid="50">Research Interests</a></span></h1></div><!-- react-empty: 51 --><!-- react-empty: 52 --><!-- react-empty: 53 --><!-- react-empty: 54 --><div class="Paragraph ms-t-a-j" data-reactid="55"><p>My research interests have always concerned the practical use, development, and design of interactive learning technologies in blended and online language classrooms. Merriam (2009) stated, practitioners concern themselves with studies that present information they can transfer to their own settings for application. For this reason, my publications have been based on action research, research that aims to improve the quality of teaching and learning and the tools available to both create collaborative, critical thinking, and innovative learning online environments (Altrichter et al., 1993). I have examined and presented on various elements of technology that teachers could adapt and use in their classroom. From video games, websites, instructional videos, and the flipped classroom, my focus has been on providing practical tools that reduced teacher talk time and increased student interaction based on quality feedback and assessments. After enrolling in Pepperdine’s doctoral program my focus continued, but grew to include ‘why’, a deeper understanding with data to support the research questions. My dissertation examines the lived experiences of Japanese university students studying English as a foreign language in the flipped classroom setting. From providing teachers with practical tools to the effectiveness of interactive learning technologies in both the blended and online environments, my research interests have matured. </p></div><div class="Paragraph ms-t-a-j" data-reactid="56"><p>Based on my training and professional observations, there are occasions when college instructors attempt to adapt technology into their undergraduate courses before understanding the students’ views or abilities to properly use the technology. Although instructors may wish to use technology simply because technology is cool and students enjoy it, instructors need to carefully consider how students use technology for learning. Students use social media for a variety of reasons—to keep up to date with their friends, follow who’s hot and who’s not—but do students enjoy using technology to study and learn? Students who partake in a course where the instructor uses technology may not be learning as much as the instructor believes, or as much as he/she could in a traditional course. With the growth of MOOCs and online learning programs, I feel there is a need for research pertaining to how students view learning in a technology rich environment focusing on aiding language acquisition through the creation of a sense of presence based on activities that engage the learner and provide quality feedback. </p></div></div></div></section><section id="section-h_HeadingTextual-275ad228-0e89-4a01-a6dd-e455f12d6e08" class="Section Section--components-1 color-title title-size-large p-0 ms-p-3 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8  color-bg text-align-center  colors-black colors-global " data-reactid="57"><div class="Component ms-fx-r p-1 " data-reactid="58"><div class="Group Group--heading p-1 fx-2" data-reactid="59"><div class="System-font  Headline" data-reactid="60"><h1 data-reactid="61"><span class="" data-reactid="62"><a class="font-title " href="apps" data-reactid="63">Apps</a></span></h1></div><!-- react-empty: 64 --><!-- react-empty: 65 --><!-- react-empty: 66 --></div><div class="Group Group--textual p-1 fx-1" data-reactid="67"><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="68"><p>With the dramatic increase in smart devices Apps have become a great learning tool that are easy to set up and use both in-class and for independent study.
