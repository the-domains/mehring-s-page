_In Hanging Out, Messing Around, and Geeking Out: Kids Learning With New Media_

Ito et al. (2010) asked the question: How can I utilize the available resources, both social and technological, for deep exploration? 

Today's university student is not simply focused on studying; many of them are involved in extracurricular activities and work and have an active social life. The diverse needs of each learner require a learning environment that is not rigid, but adjustable to their hectic schedules. 

Greater access to technology has opened up new avenues in terms of how to provide students with information and what students are able to do with it. 

Using technology to collaborate and gather information and exploiting online discussion forums to extend in-class learning outside the classroom, technology provides students time to review and practice new learning before demonstrating competence. 

Incorporating technology into the classroom provides students with an effective, interactive pedagogy that allows them to transfer new information and make sense of and assimilate the information.

My teaching experience makes it possible for me to relate to faculty, to understand the needs, challenges and sometimes frustrations that faculty and students have when using technology. Helping faculty design courses using the

and

methodologies as well as incorporating

and

[creative commons][3]

materials has enabled faculty to design courses with

higher levels of student collaboration, interaction, communication, creativity, innovation and critical thinking; skills essential if one is to posses the competencies of the 21st century, a self-directed, ethical citizen who is an engaged and confident thinker.

Considering new technologies are always sprouting up I have created a list
