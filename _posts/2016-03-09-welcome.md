WELCOME!

Glad you made it here and I hope you find the site -- and the ideas -- beneficial. Feel free to look around and contact me anytime.

The main purpose of this site is to

share and demonstrate my ideas on the integration of technology and utilization of brain-based research into second language education. It

is used as a tool to assess my own skills and professional growth by allowing others to view and give feedback on my research and activities. This feedback will enable me to strengthen my weaknesses, explore new methods, and learn from others; essentially improving my craft.

**_Follow me on Twitter, Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn, or my blog by clicking the proper icon located at the top right of this page._**

A few new items to my website:

1. To save space I have created a Google spreadsheet that will list the types of technology used in my classes. Feel free to send me additional ideas or download the list for your own personal use.
2. With the saved space I will now upload videos of me demonstrating how I incorporate the various pieces of technology. As I come across new technologies I will place the older ones on the Google spreadsheet. I am hoping this will help and encourage you to use the technology.

My two favorite proverbs:

Do not confine your students to your own learning, for they were born in another time.---Chinese Proverb

Tell me and I'll forget. Show me and I may not remember. Involve me and I'll understand.---Native American Proverb
