Glad you made it here and I hope you find the site -- and the ideas -- beneficial. Feel free to look around and contact me anytime.

The main purpose of this site is to share and demonstrate my ideas on the integration of technology and utilization of brain-based research into second language education. It is used as a tool to assess my own skills and professional growth by allowing others to view and give feedback on my research and activities. This feedback will enable me to strengthen my weaknesses, explore new methods, and learn from others; essentially improving my craft.

My two favorite proverbs:

Do not confine your students to your own learning, for they were born in another time.---Chinese Proverb

Tell me and I'll forget. Show me and I may not remember. Involve me and I'll understand.---Native American Proverb
