My research interests have always concerned the practical use, development, and design of interactive learning technologies in blended and online language classrooms. Merriam (2009) stated, practitioners concern themselves with studies that present information they can transfer to their own settings for application. For this reason, my publications have been based on action research, research that aims to improve the quality of teaching and learning and the tools available to both create collaborative, critical thinking, and innovative learning online environments (Altrichter et al., 1993). I have examined and presented on various elements of technology that teachers could adapt and use in their classroom. From video games, websites, instructional videos, and the flipped classroom, my focus has been on providing practical tools that reduced teacher talk time and increased student interaction based on quality feedback and assessments. After enrolling in Pepperdine's doctoral program my focus continued, but grew to include 'why', a deeper understanding with data to support the research questions. My dissertation examines the lived experiences of Japanese university students studying English as a foreign language in the flipped classroom setting. From providing teachers with practical tools to the effectiveness of interactive learning technologies in both the blended and online environments, my research interests have matured. 

Based on my training and professional observations, there are occasions when college instructors attempt to adapt technology into their undergraduate courses before understanding the students' views or abilities to properly use the technology. Although instructors may wish to use technology simply because technology is cool and students enjoy it, instructors need to carefully consider how students use technology for learning. Students use social media for a variety of reasons---to keep up to date with their friends, follow who's hot and who's not---but do students enjoy using technology to study and learn? Students who partake in a course where the instructor uses technology may not be learning as much as the instructor believes, or as much as he/she could in a traditional course. With the growth of MOOCs and online learning programs, I feel there is a need for research pertaining to how students view learning in a technology rich environment focusing on aiding language acquisition through the creation of a sense of presence based on activities that engage the learner and provide quality feedback. 

A major challenge facing online educators is how to become better facilitators of knowledge acquisition in the online learning environment. Social networking tools help us to express our need to be together with others and in order to create this sense of presence online one needs to think, feel, and behave differently than in a face-to-face environment because the online environment makes it more difficult to be aware of the feelings and thoughts of other's (Biocca, Burgoon, Harms, & Stoner, 2001), mainly due to a lack of facial and verbal cues. With a stronger understanding of these differences, one is better able to design, develop, and create meaningful online learning environments. I am interested in examining how instructors can create this sense of presence because as Munro (1998) pointed out when a sense of presence is evident it greatly enhances the learning environment for both instructors and students. Instructors and learners need to better understand how to build a community, construct knowledge collaboratively, and be present during online discussions, points that are key to my teaching philosophy. Designing and developing activities that engage the learner should help create this sense of presence.

Nonetheless, a sense of presence alone will not lead to a successful online course. Activities that challenge students in a more playful way, encourage them to collaborate with classmates and teacher, both asynchronously and synchronously, makes learning more enjoyable and students more willing to participate. The creation of new knowledge not only takes place inside one's head, but because individuals are situated in a social environment interacting with different groups on a daily basis (Vygotsky, 1978), knowledge is acquired through this interaction with others, (Vygotsky, 1981) and the internalization of these interactions can be demonstrated by the creation of a public artifact that demonstrates one's new learning (Papert, 1980). In the online environment, the use of tests and quizzes are not suitable to demonstrate one's new learning. An engaging activity that would demonstrate new learning is project-based learning (PBL), an instructional approach based on authentic learning activities that engage student interest and motivation. In this type of activity, PBL, students are lead collaboratively through the learning by an intriguing question, demanding students to explore and struggle with real-world problems and meet challenges (Larmer, 2000). Another similar activity is reciprocal teaching which is a collaborative learning method that requires students to teach one another through the use of four components including summarizing, questioning, clarifying, and predicting (Palincsar, A. S., & Brown, A. L., 1984). One example of reciprocal teaching is peer instruction (Marzu, 2009) a method where theoretical questions, designed to divulge common misunderstandings, are spread throughout an activity to actively engage students. Similarly, WebQuests or quest-based learning empowers students to pursue answers or collaboratively create an artifact that demonstrates their understanding of the correct answer. The design and development of engaging activities that push students to work collaboratively and create artifacts that demonstrate new learning should increase student online engagement and lead to a greater sense of presence. 

In summary, I strive to support and develop a repository of open educational resources (OER) that lead to the creation of high quality blended and online learning experiences for both faculty and students. 

I am focused on, and striving to find the answers to the impact OER resources could have on developing a sense of presence and engaging students.
