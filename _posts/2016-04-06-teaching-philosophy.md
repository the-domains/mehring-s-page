# Teaching Philosophy

My philosophy has always been based on teaching methods that integrate technologies to enhance and expand the second language learning environment in ways unobtainable by traditional methods. Conole (2004) expressed it perfectly when he said, there is a lapse between what is proposed and the actual use of technology in the classroom; there is minimal evidence that fundamental change in education has taken place as a result of the application of emerging technologies. Teachers need to create environments and experiences where students come together, either face-to-face or online, to discover and construct new learning, become members of the community of learners, and solve problems (Barr & Tagg, 1995). In this new ecological learning environment, students learn to be active learners and constructors of their knowledge, developing and creating entire frameworks of new knowledge through collaborative, authentic use of students' previous knowledge. In keeping with van Lier's (2000) principles of ecological education, I am continually looking for new ways of teaching, integrating technology into learning, and researching education in order to expand the quality of the learner's environment both inside and outside the classroom. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/630c7bcf-b703-4711-abae-60ca68b49aee.png)

With changes in technology evolving at unprecedented rates, empowered students who possess 21st century skills will be the most prepared for their future. Students who possess these skills take responsibility for their learning outcomes, becoming more innovative, collaborative, and better critical thinkers both inside and outside the classroom, that is, students see the benefits or gain an understanding of the curriculum objectives. Equipping students for learning in an ecological environment, I want to provide them with suitable tools and learning resources. Many tools and resources can be used to accomplish this goal. Among these, however, it is my belief that technology is the prime resource to this end. Properly designed learning spaces create rich, in-class learning environments in which I not only facilitate interaction, but also build upon them through collaborative face-to-face and online activities providing opportunities to enhance student empowerment and outcomes.

To reach this end I have combined the flipped classrooms concept and Google forms to create a just-in-time, (Edwards et al., 2006), learning environment. By pushing the didactic learning out to students via videos/podcasts and students answering a short questionnaire through Google forms before the next class, I gain a better understanding of students interests, misunderstandings, and weaknesses before class, allowing me to adapt lessons to a differentiated learning environment. Here, students are able to work at their own pace on experiential and project-based learning activities and I am able to work with each student on their misunderstandings from the information obtained through the Google form. By flipping I have created an environment where students can test their ideas, collaborate with classmates and me, becoming more creative and innovative in their thought process. An example of this is one of my content-based classes that focuses on American culture. Initially, I made a few videos using Google Earth so students could gain an understanding of each lesson's objectives. In-class learning focused on experiential, project-based learning as students' researched and created  additional videos on a topic/area of their choice. Not only are these videos from the student's perspective and voice, but also the videos went through a process of successes and failures as the students gained a better understanding of the technology and knowledge of the material being presented. The combination of technology and learning through the flipped classroom expands the student's learning environment to deeper testing and exploring of ideas applied to real life situations. The affordances a flipped classroom offers is just one piece of the learning puzzle, materials used to engage the students also possess their own affordances.

In my mission to provide appropriate learning resources, I do my best to understand and recognize that learning materials also have affordances. I want to present the students with the most suitable learning materials; that means researching and understanding what materials my students feel comfortable with and developing them to be used in and out of the classroom. Teachers need to exploit tools their students feel comfortable with and build on students' schemata to help them in the learning process. It is my strong belief that students enjoy learning when they are intellectually, emotionally, socially, and physically involved in communicating with others, which creates a deeper desire to learn even more and encourages empowerment. This is what I strive to bring to each and every lesson.

In all of my classes I have incorporated various Apps and websites to offer students suitable materials. gWhiz Pro is an App that used together with Google Docs allows a teacher to create flashcards embedded with audio and visual elements. Used in connection with the Quizlet website the two offer a more unique and fun way to study vocabulary than the traditional paper-based system. zondle is a web-based game that enables a teacher to teach with immersive gaming (TWIG), a concept developed by Dr. Howard-Jones (2012) who explained that dopamine is the reason children love computer games. Students learn more, and are happier to continue learning, when they are offered 'the chance of' a reward rather than 'guaranteed' a reward. The reason for this is that uncertain reward is thought to generate more dopamine in the brain's reward system. This suggests a way in which teachers can harness the power of games in their lessons. The affordances of interactive technology enable me to immerse the students in the learning environment, build critical thinking skills and empower learners.

In conclusion, my learning environment makes learning an active process, collaborating with classmates, and teachers, through the affordances offered by technology. Understanding why my students want to learn helps me create more authentic lessons. The affordances offered by technology allow me to immerse the students in the learning, giving students more opportunities to interact and create their collaborative learning environment where they feel comfortable and relaxed and can learn from their classmates. Through this collaborative environment, my students become more autonomous and empowered to take control of their learning outcomes, which is the ultimate goal of my teaching philosophy.
