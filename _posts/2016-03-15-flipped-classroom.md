Working in an immersive English as a Foreign Language (EFL) program in Japan involves finding new and creative ways to present material that enable students to interact with the teacher and classmates in authentic, academic discussions. If I spend 50 or 60% of class time lecturing to students, it leaves them few opportunities to interact with the teacher or classmates about their new learning and to make the new knowledge their own. Flipping provides the teacher with more opportunities to scaffold learning, develop critical thinking skills, and to spend more time on task.

When the classroom is flipped, students have access to new material enabling them to come to class better prepared and to take part in in-class activities. Benkler (2006) stated the networked information economy is characterized by decentralized, individual action that plays a greater role than in the industrialized information economy. Decentralizing the learning by pushing didactic information outside the classroom offers EFL students greater opportunities to communicate using authentic language, engage in critical thinking, and interact in the classroom. EFL students' access to a video lecture beforehand creates the possibility for them to connect new information with background knowledge and develop their thoughts and ideas in an asynchronous environment. Providing new information when students are ready, just in time, scaffolds use of new vocabulary, grammar structures and content in the face-to-face environment. In class, the teacher continues to guide students through their Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) empowering them to perform at their highest potential (Vygotsky, 1978). Through scaffolding, students encounter supported opportunities to practice the language and material that empower them to become better critical thinkers as well. 

Flipping is a valuable tool for both teachers and students in the EFL classroom. Opportunities to scaffold learning, develop critical thinking skills and to spend more time on task empower students create an environment for authentic language use.
